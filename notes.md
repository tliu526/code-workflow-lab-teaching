## Outline

### Overarching themes

- balance between "getting things done" and "doing things the right way"

### Reproducibility

- Docker

### Documentation

- Document as you write
- Write documentation in a format that is parseable

### Testing 

- test-driven development
- python unittest
- python assert

- scripting
- batch processing: nohup and tmux/screen

#### Harder things
